# Claculator
A reverse Polish notation calculator with added features such as comparisons, branching, and custom recursive operators taken from the Clac project from the 15-122 course at Carnegie Mellon University. The project is built around a 6502 microprocessor with a custom architecture to reduce CPU load by making peripherals operate asyncronously.
